    <!-- HTML: Heading,paragraph,Images -->
    <!--Let's see if we can host an Image on our Localhost using Python and put it into our html-->
    <img
      src="http://127.0.0.1:8080/FrontEnd/HTML/HTML%28basics%29/Dp.jpg"
      alt="No image found"
      height="200"
    />
    <!--Above code will only work when we have hosted the image on our localhost....Also notice the name of directory is HTML(basic) but we used %28 and %29 beacuse url doesn't have these characters e.g space bar is %20 which is ASCII value of space-->
    <!--Now let's see if we can hook our browser tab to index.js file...so that we can control it from localhost now and any ip later-->
    <!--This is what the browser exploitation framework(BEEF) uses...which is used by a lot of hackers-->

  <!--We can change the ip address and it will be linked to the file hosted at that...we can try that with ngrok-->
